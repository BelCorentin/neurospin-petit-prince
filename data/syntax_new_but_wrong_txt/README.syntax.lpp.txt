The parsing of *Le Petit Prince* was performed by Maximin Coavoux <maximin.coavoux@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr> using Mind the Gap <https://gitlab.com/mcoavoux/mtgpy>. The result is in `french_data_lpp_2023_04_03.zip`

I  split `lpp_cleaned_french2_patched_mtg_projective.discbracket` into the nine parts `ch*.syntax.txt` corresponding to the chunks presented to the participants in the fMRI and MEG experiments.
